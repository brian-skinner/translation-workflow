   Congratulations, if you're reading this comment, you're probably 
   one of first in the world to look at this code!  
  
   We checked in this first draft once we had the initial features 
   working and the basic structure in place, and now the next step 
   is to get a proper code review and start improving the quality 
   of the code.  All the code below this line is eagerly awaiting 
   your review comments.
