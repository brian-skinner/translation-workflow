# What is the [translation-workflow](https://code.google.com/p/translation-workflow/) app? #

The **translation-workflow** app is a web-based tool for community translation projects.  The app allows volunteers to pick what items they want to translate, mark translations as ready for review, etc.

The **translation-workflow** app is designed to serve as a simple workflow system on top of [Google Translator Toolkit](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/06/google-translator-toolkit.html), which is where volunteers translate individual documents.

The app is written in Java on App Engine.

# History #

The **translation-workflow** app was started in 2011 by staff at [google.org](http://www.google.org/).  The 2011 version builds off of google.org's earlier experience with the 2010 [Health Speaks](http://sitescontent.google.com/healthspeaks/) pilot project.
